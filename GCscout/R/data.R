#' This is a correlation matrix that was first introduced in a numeric study
#' Witten & Tibshirani (2009) for similar covariance-regularized regression
#' problems, see Simulation 6 in Witten & Tibshirani (2009). After appending to
#' the column the correlation between \code{x} and
#' \code{y} followed by an extra step of normalization, we made this matrix
#' into a 9x9 correlation matrix. This is exactly the same matrix we used for
#' Simulation 5 in our paper (Quan et al (2020)).
